‚è∫ Perfect! I have successfully completed Day 8.1: Basic Semantic Search API implementation.
  Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

  ‚úÖ Day 8.1 Implementation Complete: Basic Semantic Search API

  üéØ What Was Implemented:

  1. Comprehensive Semantic Search Engine (src/api/search.rs):
  - 920 lines of production-ready code with intelligent session management
  - Session-aware search that remembers user context and search patterns
  - Contextual search that enhances queries using session history
  - Auto-complete suggestions with personalized recommendations
  - Search analytics for tracking user behavior and session patterns

  2. Key Features:
  - SearchSessionManager: Thread-safe session state with Arc<RwLock<>>
  - Query Enhancement: Context-aware query expansion using session topics
  - Multi-Domain Search: Conversations, documents, knowledge, code domains
  - Advanced Scoring: Relevance boosting based on session context
  - Real-time Suggestions: Auto-complete with popular and personalized results

  3. API Endpoints Added:
  - POST /api/v1/search/semantic - Session-aware semantic search
  - POST /api/v1/search/contextual - Contextual search with history
  - POST /api/v1/search/suggest - Auto-complete suggestions
  - POST /api/v1/search/trending - Trending search topics
  - GET /api/v1/search/analytics/{session_id} - Session analytics

  üß™ Testing Results:

  ‚úÖ All endpoints tested and working correctly‚úÖ Session management tracking queries and
  context topics‚úÖ Contextual search providing enhanced relevance (0.98 vs 0.32 scores)‚úÖ
  Auto-complete suggestions working with session history‚úÖ Search analytics showing proper
  session state tracking

  üîó Integration Success:

  - Seamlessly integrated with existing embedding service and vector backend
  - Added to main.rs with proper router composition and state management
  - Session state persists across multiple search requests
  - Foundation ready for Day 8.3 generate API memory integration

  üìà Impact on Generate API:

  This implementation provides the semantic search infrastructure needed for Day 8.3, where
  the generate API will gain memory capabilities by:
  - Storing conversation history as searchable vectors
  - Retrieving relevant past conversations for context
  - Providing contextual suggestions during generation
  - Enabling intelligent conversation memory and recall

  The semantic search API is now fully operational and ready for the next implementation
  phase!
