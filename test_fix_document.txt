Machine Learning Best Practices

1. Data Preprocessing
Always clean and normalize your data before training. Remove outliers and handle missing values properly.

2. Model Selection
Choose the right algorithm for your problem. For classification, consider Random Forest or SVM. For regression, try Linear Regression or XGBoost.

3. Feature Engineering
Create meaningful features from raw data. This often makes the biggest difference in model performance.

4. Cross Validation
Use k-fold cross validation to get reliable estimates of model performance. Never test on your training data.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Use grid search or random search to find optimal hyperparameters. This can significantly improve results.
